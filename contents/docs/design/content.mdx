# Content

> As with all communication, content and context is key. Being mindful of how voice and tone correspond to the content will ensure that what we’re saying is recieved the way we intend it to be.


### Voice and Tone

A consistent voice and tone in all brand messaging is crucial to establishing a connection with users. It is at the core of our personality, and conveys an attitude toward the subject matter and reader.

Content should never be complex or fragmented, and should always be free of jargon. Rather, it should be more conversational like having a discussion with a friend. Although casual, it should not be informal nor sloppy! Conversational content still needs to remain clear, concise, and easy to understand. 

Here are some samples of conversational copy:

### Illustrations

##### The Staples brand uses illustrations to communicate moods, create context and serve as decoration.

<br/>

Our illustrations feature strong outlines that maintain a uniform stroke weight. They are also monochromatic to be less distracting. 

To create a monochromatic illustration, choose a background colour and a stroke colour that’s either white or same as the background, but lighter or darker in value. Make sure that the chosen line colour is clearly visible and contrasts the chosen background nicely.

Never fill in any parts of the illustration as they are always to remain outlined with no fill. For something more realistic like an illustrated map, objects can be separated by solid colours alone, without a stroke.  

The illustrative shapes and lines are geometric, straight-edged, uniform and as close to real proportions as possible. No oblong or ‘squigly’ lines are to be used.

### Resolution

It's important to resize illustrations according to context and platform. 

When using illustrations for digital, the image should not be too small to make out the shapes and content, or too large for quick loading times. Use vector based formats such as svg or eps for full scalability. For images of a fixed size, png is preferred for vectors and sharp graphics.

Please use only high-resolution images (at least 300 dpi) in a supported image format (jpg or png) for raster images and lifestyle photography.

### Photography

When it comes to selecting an image for banners, promos, carousels and to accompany content, choose lifestyle photography. This allows users to easily immerse themselves in the photo and resonate with the product. Lifestyle photography is also effective in establishing a realistic environment and ambience.

For banners and carousels, it is best to choose images that are content-heavy on the right side, so the left can be free to communicate the accompanying message.

Overlays can be used to lighten up or darken areas of an image, and serve as a backdrop to text. This helps to make the copy more discernible from the contents of its background.

### Graphic Treatment

When it comes to composing banners and graphics for Staples digital, it’s important to remain consistent in our use of colour, messaging and imagery. Avoid floating objects as it lacks context and prevents the user from immersing themselves in an environment or setting. 

Never use our brand red solely as an accent colour. Staples Red is to be used intentionally and purposefully, such as in CTA buttons on a banner, carousel or hero image. In cases where you may need to highlight important or additional information, our secondary and tertiary colour palettes can be used. 
Note, there should be a limit of one CTA button style per page. This establishes hierarchy and encourages the user to engage with the content as they are intended to. For additional buttons and actions, please use our default button styles.

### Layout

##### The layout for all creative content must be organized on an invisible grid.

When content uses a grid system to ensure graphical and textual components maintain a clean and aligned appearance, it is evident. Grid systems are what separates good design from bad design, as it establishes a layout that is naturally harmonious and rhythmically balanced.  

When elements and components are aligned on an invisible grid, viewers are able to easily scan the page in a natural and fluid manner. See [Grid & Sizes](#) to learn more about creating grids.
