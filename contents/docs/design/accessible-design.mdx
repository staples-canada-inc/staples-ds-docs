# Accessibility

> Staples believes that web and software experiences should be accessible to everyone, regardless of abilities or impairments. We are committed to following and complying with best practices when it comes to accessibility.

## Why Digital Accessibility?

Accessible design not only helps users with disabilities; it provides better user experiences for everyone. In Ontario, business are required to meet AA web accesssibility standards. The Web must be accessible to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities.

### Increase Market Research

In the US, the annual discretionary spending of people with disabilities is over \$200 billion. The global estimate of the disability market is nearly \$7 trillion. In countries with life expectancies of over 70 years of age, people spend 11.5 percent of their lifespan living with a disability.

### Brand Enhancement

Potential outcomes for digital accessibility include enhanced brand image and reputation, increased sales and customer loyalty, improved workforce diversity and many other benefits.

### It's Good for Business

Case studies show that accessible websites have better search results, reduced maintenance costs, and increased audience reach, among other benefits.

### Search Engine Optimization

Many people understand that the search engines read the words and images of a website, few understand that they also read the code. The search algorithms detect pages with accessible code and content and move them higher on the search engine results pages.

### It Fosters Community

The Web is designed to work for all people, whatever their language, location, or ability. It meets this goal when it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.

## Types of Disability

### Blind Users

Blind users may use a screen reader to experience interfaces or rely on Braille output. They also cannot be expected to use a pointer or mouse for input.

Designers should consider whether the visual information is translated effectively into text and if the image can be understood through its metadata alone? When possible, it is ideal to test all designs through a screen reader.

As audio-only interfaces gain popularity through devices like AI assistants, users are expecting more and more from the audio representations of experiences.

### Low-Vision Users

Low vision can include partial sight in one or both eyes and can range from mild to severe. It affects approximately 4% of the world’s population. Users with low vision may use screen readers, screen magnifiers, high-contrast modes, and/or monochrome displays. They may also need to adjust their the default browser font size to a larger setting.

Designers should take page magnification into consideration when establishing the hierarchy and structure of the content. Keyboard best practices should also be followed and tested to ensure the page’s content is read to the user in a logical order.

On average, an individual’s vision gradually worsens around the age of 40. Even your typical user may need to view screens in poor lighting conditions (i.e. outside on a bright day, an office space with an abundance of natural light, etc.) A higher-contrast design will make the screen more usable for a wider demographic.

### Colour-Blind Users

Color-blindness affects 8% of men and 0.4% of women. Colour-blind users will not be able to differentiate between some colors on an interface. Therefore, it is best practice to not rely on colour alone to convey meaning.

Designers should use a combination of size, weight, colour and other variables to establish hierarchy, indicate an action or differentiate visual elements. A good way to test your design is to run it through a color-blind simulator. We recommend the [Stark](https://getstark.co/) plugin when working in Sketch.

### Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing Users

Those who are deaf or hard-of-hearing will rely heavily on captioning and other alternative representations of audio.

Designers should avoid conveying information exclusively with sound. Any videos or animations with meaningful audio should be transcribed and captioned.

All users can benefit from closed captioning. In situations where it may not be appropriate to turn your sound on, such as a library or in a noisy setting, captions would allow a better user experience.

### Physical Disabilities

Users with physical disabilities may rely on keyboards, track balls, voice recognition, and other assistive technologies to interact with an interface.

Designers should ensure all actions are keyboard accessible and efficient. A good way to design with keyboard interaction in mind is to spend some time navigating the web, email, and digital products using only the keyboard.

Many users prefer to navigate interfaces solely with a keyboard for efficiency. Good keyboard navigation can help everyone be more productive.

### Cognitive Disabilities

Users with cognitive disabilities cover a broad spectrum and can have difficulty with any of the following:

-   Memory
-   Problem solving
-   Attention
-   Reading, linguistic, and verbal comprehension
-   Math comprehension
-   Visual comprehension

They may have a limited working memory and require information to remain visible at all times during the completion of a task. They may also experience seizures when exposed to rapid motion or flashing content (epilepsy).

Designers should consider the adverse effects of flashing animations and rapid motion on the brain and design accordingly. It is best to follow standard conventions for web and keep error messages or copy clear and concise.

Best practices for cognitive disabilities benefit all users. Busy environments can tax your cognitive load, and aging adults may experience a decline in their cognitive abilities. Placing a low cognitive load on users reduces mistakes and improves effectiveness, regardless of their abilities.

## Usage

### Font Size and Colour

Content must have a sufficient amount of contrast between foreground and background to enable users with moderately low vision to read it without contrast-enhancing technology.

When designing a responsive website that can be viewed on mobile devices, you want to ensure that body copy is as readable on your phone, when held at a natural distance, as it is on desktop.
It is recommended to always view and test your design on the device for which it is intended.

Below is a summary of digital best practices when it comes to font size and colour.

### Standard Text

Use a text input and body copy size of at least **16 px** on desktop and mobile. Standard text must have a contrast ratio of at least **4.5:1**.

### Large Text

Large text (at least **24 px** regular or light / **19 px** semi-bold) must have a contrast ratio of **3:1**.

### Secondary Text

For secondary text, unimportant labels or captions use a size of at least **14 px**.

### Text Against Non-static Backgrounds

When text is rendered on a gradient background or image, make sure the text color meets contrast standards in all places it appears. This is especially important for parallax applications or animations where text and backgrounds are moving independently of each other.

### UI Components

Visual information used to indicate states and boundaries of UI components must have a contrast ratio of **3:1** against adjacent colors. This includes form elements.

## Approved Colour Combinations

To meet accessability requirements and to support as many devices as possible, the brand colours have been adapted/expanded specifically for digital. The following colour combinations meet the contrast ratio requirements for WCAG AA standards, at minimum.

### Primary Colours

White on Staples Red and vice versa, meet the contrast ratio for WCAG AA standards, as well as AAA standards when large text is used. Text should never appear lighter than our Mid-Gray on white.
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-3 text-center">
        <img src={approved_staples_red} />
        <p>Staples Red</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-3 text-center">
        <img src={approved_white} />
        <p>White</p>
    </div>
</div>

### Secondary Colours

Charcoal paired with White and Lightest-Gray meet the WCAG AA and AAA standards for both large and standard text. Mid-Gray paired with White, and Light-Gray with Charcoal, pass AA standards, as well as AAA standards at larger text sizes.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-3 text-center">
        <img src={approved_charcoal} />
        <p>Charcoal</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-3 text-center">
        <img src={approved_mid_gray} />
        <p>Mid-Gray</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-3 text-center">
        <img src={approved_light_gray} />
        <p>Light-Gray</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-3 text-center">
        <img src={approved_lightest_gray} />
        <p>Lightest-Gray</p>
    </div>
</div>

### Tertiary Colours

Charcoal text is to be used on all tertiary colours, with the exception of Dark Blue.  White copy on Dark Blue meets the contrast ratio and WCAG AA standards.

The only tertiary colour combination to meet AAA standards across the board is Lightest-Blue paired with Charcoal.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-3 text-center">
        <img src={approved_chartreuse} />
        <p>Chartreuse</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-3 text-center">
        <img src={approved_dark_blue} />
        <p>Dark Blue</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-3 text-center">
        <img src={approved_blue} />
        <p>Blue</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-3 text-center">
        <img src={approved_lightest_blue} />
        <p>Lightest-Blue</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-3 text-center">
        <img src={approved_cork} />
        <p>Cork</p>
    </div>
</div>

## Keyboard Accessibility

Keyboard accessibility is helpful for users who rely on or prefer using a keyboard. Make sure to provide keyboard functionality to all interactive content. Common keyboard interactions include using the `tab` key to select different interactive elements on a page and using the `enter` key or the `spacebar` to activate an in-focus element.

### Focus Indicators

The `tab` key navigates through all interactive elements on a page in the order they appear in the HTML document. A default visual indicator is provided by the web browser in use. The display is a border around the focused element. When an element is in focus, it can be further activated using the keyboard.

### Navigation Order

Think of code hierarchy when structuring your content so that screen readers and keyboard-only users can access interactive elements in a logical and predictable order via tabbing. Create the tab flow hierarchy by using the source code to arrange the keyboard navigation. Begin with the header, followed by the main navigation, then page navigation (from left to right, top to bottom), and end with the footer. The objective is to give keyboard users an intentional experience that is comparable to the experience of mouse users.

### Landmarks

Communicate to screen-reader users the different areas of the screen and what they do with landmarks and by using appropriate HTML5 labels. Screen reader users can then quickly jump to any area they want.

## Code Best Practices (HTML, CSS and JS)

### Semantic HTML

Use native HTML elements as much as you can, and use them for their correct purpose. These elements have built-in accessibility benefits. They inform screen readers what they are and what they do, and standard interactive elements, such as a button, include keyboard functionality. Aside from making it accessible, this will also make it easier to develop and maintain, better on mobile, and good for search engine optimization.

```html
<button>Play Video</button>
<header></header>
<main></main>
<nav></nav>
<footer></footer>
<aside></aside>
<section></section>
<article></article>
```

### Use Clear language

When adding content, consider cognitive disabilities, anyone whose native language isn’t the language your content is written in, and screen readers. When possible, avoid dashes, abbreviations, acronyms (at least the first time), and table layouts if a table is not needed. If abbreviating, use the native `<abbr />` element with title attribute.

```html
"9 to 5" "November" <abbr title="November">Nov</abbr>
```

### Meaningful Text Labels

Consider visually impaired people when labeling elements. Make sure there is textual context for screen readers and button text is descriptive. Avoid vague call-to-actions like “Click here”.

```html
<!-- Do this -->
Read more about pricing

<!-- NOT this -->
Click here
```

### Accessible Data Tables

Always specify table headers with `<th />` elements, and make sure they stand out. Utilize scope attribute if necessary to specify if they are headers for rows or columns. Utilize alternative text along with tables for visually impaired users. `<caption />` is preferred, but `<table />` summary works too.

```html
<table summary="Names and Ages of My Coworkers">
	<caption>
		Names and Ages of My Coworkers
	</caption>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th scope="col">Firstname</th>
			<th scope="col">Lastname</th>
			<th scope="col">Age</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Jane</td>
			<td>Smith</td>
			<td>22</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Tom</td>
			<td>West</td>
			<td>47</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
```

### Accessible Data Visualization

It is important to take into account visually impaired users when including data visualizations. Consider accompanying visuals with a data table as another alternative for users who rely on screen readers.

### Multimedia Text Alternatives

Every image that is not decorative must include `alt` text with a meaningful description of the image and a `title` attribute. You can also utilize `aria-labelledby` along with id attributes instead of alt text.

Please note, if the image is decorative, use an empty `alt` attribute; otherwise the screen reader will read the whole image url if the `alt` is left out.

```html
<!-- Example 1 -->

![](puppy.jpg" title="Sleeping Puppy)A sleeping puppy" />
```

```html
<!-- Example 2 -->

![](puppy2.jpg" aria-labelledby="imagelabel" />
<p id="imagelabel">This is a picture of a cute puppy in cup</p>
```

### Audio Alternatives

Provide closed-captioning with videos or transcriptions of audio files.

```html
<video controls>
	<source src="example.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
	<source src="example.webm" type="video/webm" />
	<track kind="subtitles" src="subtitles_english.vtt" srclang="en" />
</video>
```

### Font Icon Libraries

Avoid font libraries, as those are not accessible. Opt for svg files instead.

### ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Application) Roles and Landmark Roles

ARIA roles convey the intent or meaning of an element to assistive technology. This helps users navigate when they can’t see the layout and provides further context about different functionalities.

Landmark roles identify regions in a page, and act much like native HTML tags would when it comes to semantics. Signpost roles describe other information about a given element’s functionality on a page. These are especially helpful when building complex, custom interfaces or to reinforce semantics in native HTML elements.

```html
<!-- landmark roles -->
<nav role="navigation"></nav>
<main role="main"></main>
```

```html
<!-- signpost roles -->
<div role="banner">This is a banner.</div>
<div role="tabgroup"><div role="tab"></div></div>
<div role="combobox"></div>
<div role="slider"></div>
<button role="button"></button>
```

### Golden Rule of CSS

You can style a page feature to fit your design, but don’t change it to the point that it doesn’t look or behave as expected. Add styling to tabbable elements on hover and focus, so that keyboard-only users can have a clear visual understanding of where they are navigating. Never suppress the focus indicator altogether.

When hiding content from a screen reader, consider source order. Use `visibility: hidden`, along with `display: none` in your CSS.

### Golden Rule of JavaScript

Don’t rely too much on JavaScript to generate HTML and CSS. Follow the “Unobtrusive JavaScript” principle, which means that JavaScript should be used to enhance functionality not build it entirely. Use your built-in browser functionality as much as possible. If you’re utilizing JavaScript to make complex UI features, use WAI-ARIA to make elements accessible.
