# Card

A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors and powerful display options.

Cards are built with as little markup and styles as possible, but still manage to deliver a ton of control and customization. Built with flexbox, they offer easy alignment and mix well with other Bootstrap components. They have no `margin` by default, so use `spacing utilities` as needed.

Below is an example of a basic card with mixed content and a fixed width. Cards have no fixed width to start, so they’ll naturally fill the full width of its parent element. This is easily customized with our various `sizing options`.

### Basic Card

<ComponentPreview>
	<Card style={{ width: 330 }}>
		<CardImg
			top
			width="100%"
			src="https://source.unsplash.com/600x300?nature"
			alt="Card image cap"
		/>
		<CardBody>
			<CardTitle className="h5 mb-3">Card title</CardTitle>
			<CardText>
				Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up
				the bulk of the card's content.
			</CardText>
			<Button className="btn-link">View More</Button>
		</CardBody>
	</Card>
</ComponentPreview>

```html
<div class="card">
    <img class="card-img-top" src="https://source.unsplash.com/600x300?nature" alt="Card image cap" />
    <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
        <a href="#" class="card-link">View More</a>
    </div>
</div>
```

You can also use buttons with links within a card using this documentation:

### Card with Button

<ComponentPreview>
	<Card style={{ width: 500 }}>
		<CardImg
			top
			width="100%"
			src="https://source.unsplash.com/600x300?nature"
			alt="Card image cap"
		/>
		<CardBody>
			<Button color="primary" block>
				View More
			</Button>
		</CardBody>
	</Card>
</ComponentPreview>

```html
<div class="card">
    <div class="card-body">
        <button href="#" class="btn btn-primary btn-block">View More</button>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Variations

Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, list groups, links, and more. Below are examples of what’s supported.

### Body

The building block of a card is the `.card-body.` Use it whenever you need a padded section within a card.

<ComponentPreview>
	<Card style={{ width: 330 }}>
		<CardBody>
			<p>This is some text within a card body.</p>
		</CardBody>
	</Card>
</ComponentPreview>

```html
<div class="card">
    <div class="card-body">
        <p>This is some text within a card body.</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Titles, Text and Links

Card titles are used by adding `.card-title` to a `<h*>` tag. In the same way, links are added and placed next to each other by adding `.card-link` to an `<a>` tag.

Subtitles are used by adding a `.card-subtitle` to a `<h*>` tag. If the `.card-title` and the `.card-subtitle` items are placed in a `.card-body` item, the card title and subtitle are aligned nicely.

<ComponentPreview>
	<Card style={{ width: 330 }}>
		<CardBody>
			<CardTitle className="h5 mb-3">Card title</CardTitle>
			<CardSubtitle>Card subtitle</CardSubtitle>
			<CardText>
				Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up
				the bulk of the card's content.
			</CardText>
			<Button className="btn-link">View More</Button>
		</CardBody>
	</Card>
</ComponentPreview>

```html
<div class="card">
    <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Card subtitle</h6>
        <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
        <a href="#" class="card-link" >View More</a>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Images

`.card-img-top` places an image to the top of the card. With `.card-text`, text can be added to the card. Text within `.card-text` can also be styled with the standard HTML tags.

<ComponentPreview>
	<Card style={{ width: 330 }}>
		<CardImg
			top
			width="100%"
			src="https://source.unsplash.com/600x300?nature"
			alt="Card image cap"
		/>
		<CardBody>
			<CardText>
				Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up
				the bulk of the card's content.
			</CardText>
		</CardBody>
	</Card>
</ComponentPreview>

```html
<div class="card">
<img class="card-img-top" src="https://source.unsplash.com/600x300?nature" alt="Card image cap" />
    <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
    </div>
</div>
```
