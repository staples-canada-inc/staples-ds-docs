# Spinners

Staples' spinners can be used to show the loading state in your projects. They’re built with only HTML and CSS, meaning you don’t need any JavaScript to create them. You will, however, need some custom JavaScript to toggle their visibility. Their appearance, alignment, and sizing can be easily customized with our amazing utility classes

### Primary Spinners

This is the primary custom spinner built for Staples Canada.

<ComponentPreview>
	<SpinnerStaples className="mr-5" size="sm">
		Loading...
	</SpinnerStaples>
	<SpinnerStaples className="mr-5">Loading...</SpinnerStaples>
	<SpinnerStaples size="lg">Loading...</SpinnerStaples>
</ComponentPreview>

```  html
    <div role="status" class="spinner-staples">
        <div class="square"></div>
        <div class="square"></div>
        <span class="sr-only">Loading...</span>
    </div>
```

### Secondary Spinner

This is the secondary spinner to be used in cases where the primary spinner is not ideal.

<ComponentPreview>
	<Spinner color="secondary" size="sm">
		Loading...
	</Spinner>
	<Spinner color="secondary">Loading...</Spinner>
	<Spinner color="secondary" size="lg">
		Loading...
	</Spinner>
</ComponentPreview>

```  html
    <div class="spinner-border text-secondary" role="status">
      <span class="sr-only">Loading...</span>
    </div>
```

### Assistive Technology

For accessibility purposes, each loader here includes `role="status"` and a nested `<span class="sr-only">Loading...</span>`.
