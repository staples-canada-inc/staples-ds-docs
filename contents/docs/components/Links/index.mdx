# Links

Links are words on a webpage that are also a hyperlink to another page. They are used to redirect the user to a desired location when clicked on, and are often underlined within body copy or noticeable on mouse hover.

### Simple Link

Simple links would be used in places such as tabs, breadcrumbs, pagination, etc.

<ComponentPreview>
  <a href="#">Link 1</a>
  <br />
  <a href="#">Link 2</a>
  <br />
  <a href="#">Link 3</a>
</ComponentPreview>

```html
<a href="#">Link 1</a>
<a href="#">Link 2</a>
<a href="#">Link 3</a>
```

### Text Link

Text links are often underlined, in addition to coloured, to further help the user distinguish links from regular copy and meet accessibility standards.

```html
<p>This is a sample <a href="#">text link</a> within a body of text.</p>
```
