# Links

Links are words on a webpage that are also a hyperlink to another page. They are used to redirect the user to a desired location when clicked on, and are often underlined within body copy or noticeable on mouse hover.

### Simple Link

Simple links would be used in places such as tabs, breadcrumbs, pagination, etc.

<Playground>
	<a href="#">Link 1</a>
	<br />
	<a href="#">Link 2</a>
	<br />
	<a href="#">Link 3</a>
</Playground>

    <a href="#">Link 1</a><br/>
    <a href="#">Link 2</a><br/>
    <a href="#">Link 3</a>

### Text Link

Text links are often underlined, in addition to coloured, to further help the user distinguish links from regular copy and meet accessibility standards.
    
    <p>This is a sample <a href="#">text link</a> within a body of text.</p>
