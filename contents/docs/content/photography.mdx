# Photography

When it comes to selecting an image for banners, promos, carousels and to accompany content, choose lifestyle photography. This allows users to easily immerse themselves in the photo and resonate with the product. Lifestyle photography is also effective in establishing a realistic environment and ambience.

For banners and carousels, it is best to choose images that are content-heavy on the right side, so the left can be free to communicate the accompanying message.

Overlays can be used to lighten up or darken areas of an image, and serve as a backdrop to text. This helps to make the copy more discernible from the contents of its background.
