# Voice and Tone

A consistent voice and tone in all brand messaging is crucial to establishing a connection with users. It is at the core of our personality, and conveys an attitude toward the subject matter and reader.

Content should never be complex or fragmented, and should always be free of jargon. Rather, it should be more conversational like having a discussion with a friend. Although casual, it should not be informal nor sloppy! Conversational content still needs to remain clear, concise, and easy to understand. 

Here are some samples of conversational copy:

<Container>
    <Row>
        <Col md={6} >
            <Image src={voice1} />
        </Col>
        <Col md={6} >
            <Image src={voice2} />
        </Col>
    </Row>

    <Row>
        <Col md={6} >
            <Image src={voice3} />
        </Col>
        <Col md={6} >
            <Image src={voice4} />
        </Col>
    </Row>
</Container>
