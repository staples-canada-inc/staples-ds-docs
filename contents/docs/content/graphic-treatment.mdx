# Graphic Treatment

When it comes to composing banners and graphics for Staples digital, it’s important to remain consistent in our use of colour, messaging and imagery. Avoid floating objects as it lacks context and prevents the user from immersing themselves in an environment or setting. 

Never use our brand red solely as an accent colour. Staples Red is to be used intentionally and purposefully, such as in CTA buttons on a banner, carousel or hero image. In cases where you may need to highlight important or additional information, our secondary and tertiary colour palettes can be used. 
Note, there should be a limit of one CTA button style per page. This establishes hierarchy and encourages the user to engage with the content as they are intended to. For additional buttons and actions, please use our default button styles.


## Illustrations

### The Staples brand uses illustrations to communicate moods, create context and serve as decoration.


Our illustrations feature strong outlines that maintain a uniform stroke weight. They are also monochromatic to be less distracting. 

To create a monochromatic illustration, choose a background colour and a stroke colour that’s either white or same as the background, but lighter or darker in value. Make sure that the chosen line colour is clearly visible and contrasts the chosen background nicely.

Never fill in any parts of the illustration as they are always to remain outlined with no fill. For something more realistic like an illustrated map, objects can be separated by solid colours alone, without a stroke.  

The illustrative shapes and lines are geometric, straight-edged, uniform and as close to real proportions as possible. No oblong or ‘squigly’ lines are to be used.

## Resolution

It's important to resize illustrations according to context and platform. 

When using illustrations for digital, the image should not be too small to make out the shapes and content, or too large for quick loading times. Use vector based formats such as svg or eps for full scalability. For images of a fixed size, png is preferred for vectors and sharp graphics.

Please use only high-resolution images (at least 300 dpi) in a supported image format (jpg or png) for raster images and lifestyle photography.
